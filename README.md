# HDCTNet
The **H**ybrid **D**eformable **C**hannel **T**ransformer **N**etwork(HDCTNet) is designed to perform cell-level instance segmentation on mouse kidney tissue images. <br>
<br>
In this architecture, the deformable channel transformer block works as a bridge between the convolutional encoder and decoder. It is responsible for discovering cross channel feature dependencies in a more efficient way. <br>
