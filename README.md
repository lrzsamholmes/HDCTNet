# HDCTNet
The **H**ybrid **D**eformable **C**hannel **T**ransformer **N**etwork(HDCTNet), is designed to perform instance segmentation on image patches of mouse kidney whole slide images(WSIs). <br>
<br>
In this architecture, the deformable channel transformer block works as a bridge between the convolutional encoder and decoder. It is responsible for discovering cross channel feature dependencies in a more efficient way. <br>
