# HDCTNet
The hybrid deformable channel transformer network, short as HDCTNet, is designed to perform instance segmentation on image patches of mouse kidney whole slide images(WSIs). In this architecture, the deformable channel transformer block works as a bridge between the convolutional encoder and decoder. It is responsible for discovering cross channel feature dependencies in a more efficient way.
